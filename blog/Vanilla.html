                <p>"You're a marketer, writing is your hobby."</p>
                <p>I read this the other day on a writer's advice community and it's a line that feels painfully true. Whether you're self-publishing or chasing a book deal, being a writer today often means being a marketer first and a creator second.</p>
                <p>We're expected to pitch our stories like products and ourselves as authors. To an industry worth 40 Billion dollars, that's what books and authors are—Products.</p>
                <p>Once some of the most outspoken individuals in culture, authors are now increasingly hesitant to voice their opinions. More and more self-censor. More and more opinion-free. More and more digestible.</p>
                <p>Vanilla.</p>
                <p>After all, to say something, to have an opinion is to disagree with someone. That someone could be a potential reader, a potential customer.</p>
                <p>Books are just content. Market-tested, algorithm-optimized, bite-sized content.</p>
                <p>Writers are told to build brands, spark engagement, stay "on message." Trends vary arbitrarily and writers' necks snap to follow. Pirates suddenly became fashionable without clear reason the other day, prompting many authors to consider pivoting their work in that direction.</p>
                <p>Their goal isn't to say something. It's to sell. To be published. Whatever it is, just to be published.</p>
                <p>This industry of commodified literature has been co-opted by many authors, who are more concerned with making a career and status out of writing, than producing anything of cultural value. I've been threatened before to "mind my career," when expressing my opinions. And social media has codified the entire status of author—X is querying, vague, agented, editing.</p>
                <p>My career? When did writing become my job?</p>
                <p>Social media now functions as "your face as an author," like another post put it. Strong opinions alienate potential readers. Unfiltered opinions risk backlash. Publishers don't want to risk a reduced audience. Authors don't want to risk publishers not wanting to risk. So writers learn to sand down the edges, to play it safe, to remain neutral.</p>
                <p>They become—unopinionated.</p>
                <p>It's a sad irony. Writers have always been expected to say something. Not just entertain but to say… something. But that takes courage, clarity, curiosity, and a willingness to ruffle some feathers. And for those more concerned with getting the accolades of publishing and making a paycheck, that's just too much a risk.</p>
                <p>Comfort isn't literature's purpose. I'd say it's the very opposite. Writers like Baldwin, Woolf, Orwell, Morrison, never worried about causing offense. And offense they caused. They weren't trying to be palatable. They were trying to say something.</p>
                <p>But I believe this is changing. A younger generation seems less afraid of being disliked.</p>
                <p>We're moving out of the binary thinking of the 2010s, when the all-encompassing McCarthyism of cancel culture meant one misstep, one wrong tweet a decade ago, marked the end of a an individual. That absolutism is dying. In its stead this newer generation has a hunger for complexity, nuance, dialogue but especially for what's genuine.</p>
                <p>Even the platforms themselves are evolving.</p>
                <p>When Elon Musk turned Twitter into X, he significantly relaxed the controls on political and "controversial" speech. Meta followed suit months later and reduced the filters on Facebook and Instagram that had previously stifled polarizing content.</p>
                <p>And both sites experienced increased political engagement by early 2024 without the anticipated chaos. The numbers proved what everyone already knew—people can handle and want to see more variety in ideas. Perhaps we don't need to fear disagreement as much as we thought.</p>
                <p>This cultural shift offers an opportunity to readers, writers and especially publishers. The opportunity to reclaim writing as something greater than a commodity. More genuine.</p>
                <p>Readers are waiting. They have grown tired of bland viewpoints and watered-down, derivative, stories. They want to be moved, challenged, disturbed… even offended. Authors must find the courage to write stories as they believe them to be right, not safe or commercially viable.</p>
                <p>Publishers have a responsibility, too. Marketability is important, but also is meaning.</p>
                <p>This is why I'm a big believer in indie presses, or even (when done right) self publishing. Big Publishers are no different than any other corporation. They won't risk cutting away at their profits and scare investors for lofty ideals like "artistic integrity" or "human creativity". Indie publishers on the other hand take bigger risks, they are usually managed by smaller staff of dedicated individuals passionate about the craft.</p>
                <p>Self publishing presents equally exciting opportunities, but with a lot more challenges. Although it is possible to put out into the world riskier works without the constraints that even the most liberal of presses will have (i.e. a different opinion). Such constraints are often a necessary part of creating good work.</p>
                <p>If it takes a town to raise a child, it takes at least a few good people to publish a book that will read it, edit it, give feedback and revise where needed, but ultimately and most important of all, a writer open to feedback. The self publishing world often promotes the enclosure of authors into algorithmic safe spaces that they might not even realized they enter, where all they do is perfect, brilliant and genial. Dissenting opinions become personal attacks.</p>
                <p>This isn't simple. Producing meaningful works that provoke the norm takes vulnerability to criticism. Reading with an open mind involves being forced to confront difficult ideas. But the alternative—a literary world dominated by safe, agreeable, forgettable books—isn't just dull. It's a lost chance.</p>
                <p>The unopinionated author is a product of our cultural zeitgeist. The author's voice has been conditioned by fear, algorithms, pressure to appease, and even a desire for approval.</p>
                <p>We need writers who will be honest, who will speak the truth even if it is not popular. And we need a culture that accommodates it.</p>
